## Abstract

Analyzing climbing data to discover what keeps climbers strong and safe.

### 1. Discovery and Data Preparation

Part one shows the data that I have found for my project as well as the cleaning and collections of data. Finally it includes some simple visualizations.

### 2. Model Planning and Building

Part two is planning and building a model to determine the highest grade someone can climb based on serveral factors about that person. Additionally we gathered more data and did visualizations looking at climber safety.

### 3. Results and Operationalization

Finally we have the results and operationalization including a rebuild of the model and more visualization and analysis.
